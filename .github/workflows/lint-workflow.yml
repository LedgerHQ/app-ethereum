name: Code style check

# This workflow will run linting checks to ensure a level of uniformization among all Ledger applications.
#
# The presence of this workflow is mandatory as a minimal level of linting is required.
# You are however free to modify the content of the .clang-format file and thus the coding style of your application.
# We simply ask you to not diverge too much from the linting of the Boilerplate application.
