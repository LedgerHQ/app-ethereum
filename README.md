## About the project

Ethereum wallet application framework for Nano S and Nano X.  
Ledger Blue is not maintained anymore, but the app can still be compiled for this target using the branch [`blue-final-release`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-ethereum/tree/blue-final-release).

## Documentation

This app follows the specification available in the `doc/` folder.

To compile it and load it on a device, please check out our [developer portal](https://developers.ledger.com/docs/nano-app/introduction/).

### Plugins

We have the concept of plugins in the ETH app.  
Find the documentations here:  
- [Blog Ethereum plugins](https://blog.ledger.com/ethereum-plugins/)
- [Ethereum application Plugins : Technical Specifications](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-ethereum/blob/master/doc/ethapp_plugins.asc)
- [Plugin guide](https://hackmd.io/300Ukv5gSbCbVcp3cZuwRQ)
- [Boilerplate plugin](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-plugin-boilerplate)

## Testing

Testing is done via the open-source framework [zemu](https://github.com/Zondax/zemu).

### Requirements

- [nodeJS == 16](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
- [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#debian-stable)
- [build environnement](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-app-builder/blob/master/Dockerfile)

#### Build the applications required by the test suite  

1. Add your BOLOS SDKs path to:
    - `NANOS_SDK` and `NANOX_SDK`

2. Go to the `tests` folder and run `./build_local_test_elfs.sh`
    - ```sh
        cd tests
        # This helper script will build the applications required by the test suite and move them at the right place.
        yarn install
        ./build_local_test_elfs.sh
      ```

### Running all tests
#### With Makefile

1. Then you can install and run tests by simply running on the `root` of the repo:
    - ```sh
        make test
      ```
    - This will run `make install_tests` and `make run_tests`

#### With yarn

1. Go to the `tests` folder and run:
    - ```sh
        yarn test
      ```

### Running a specific tests

1.  Go to the `tests` folder and run:
    - ```sh
        yarn jest --runInBand --detectOpenHandles {YourTestFile}
      ```
2.  For example with the `send test`:
    - ```sh
        yarn jest --runInBand --detectOpenHandles src/send.test.js
      ```


### Adding tests

#### Zemu

To add tests, copy one of the already existing test files in `tests/src/`.
You then need to adapt the `buffer` and `tx` variables to adapt to the APDU you wish to send.

- Adapt the expected screen flow. Please create a folder under `tests/snapshots` with the name of the test you're performing.
- Then adapt the `ORIGINAL_SNAPSHOT_PATH_PREFIX` with the name of the folder you just created.
- To create the snapshots, modify the `SNAPSHOT_PATH_PREFIX` and set it to be equal to `ORIGINAL_SNAPSHOT_PATH_PREFIX`.
- Run the tests once, this will create all the snapshots in the folder you created.
- Put back your `SNAPSHOT_PATH_PREFIX` to `snapshots/tmp/`.

Finally make sure you adapt the expected signature!

#### Update binaries

Don't forget to update the binaries in the test folder. To do so, compile with those environement variables:

```sh
make DEBUG=1 ALLOW_DATA=1
```

Then copy the binary to the `tests/elfs` folder (in this case, compiled with SDK for nanoS):

```sh
cp bin/app.elf tests/elfs/ethereum_nanos.elf
```

Repeat the operation for a binary compiled with nanoX SDK and change for `ethereum_nanox.elf`.
