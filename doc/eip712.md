## Implementation

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant HW as Hardware Wallet
    participant SW as Software Wallet

    loop N times for N structs
        SW ->> HW: struct name
        HW ->> SW: OK / KO
        loop N times for N fields
            SW ->> HW: struct definition
            note over HW: store definition in RAM
            HW ->> SW: OK / KO
        end
    end

    opt if filtering is used
        SW ->> HW: activate filtering
        HW ->> SW: OK / KO
    end

    SW ->> HW: set root struct to "EIP712Domain"
    HW ->> SW: OK / KO
    loop N times for N fields
        SW ->> HW: struct implementation
        HW ->> SW: OK / KO
        note over HW: field is displayed
    end

    opt if filtering is used
        SW ->> HW: filtering message info
        HW ->> SW: OK / KO
    end

    SW ->> HW: set root struct to primary type
    HW ->> SW: OK / KO
    loop N times for N fields
        opt if filtering is used
            SW ->> HW: filter
            HW ->> SW: OK / KO
        end

        SW ->> HW: struct implementation
        HW ->> SW: OK / KO
        note over HW: field is displayed
    end

    SW ->> HW: SIGN
    HW ->> SW: OK (with r,s,v) / KO
```

## Traversal

The traversal of the typed data with EIP-712 must follow the same order as the definition of the types. In the second
stage of the flow when receiving the implementation of the domain & message, there is no indication in
[the APDU](ethapp.adoc#eip712-send-struct-implementation) of which field the data is for since the app has knowledge of
all the types it knows the exact order to follow so it keeps track of which field comes next and does its error-handling
accordingly.

## Filtering

Filtering is used for a better clear-signing experience with EIP-712.
It started as a simple way to define which fields to show (with the ability to give them an easier to understand name)
with all the other ones hidden to prevent the user from having too many unrelevant fields to review, and it has now
evolved into something more complex which can apply formatting to the filtered fields.

It has to be defined with the ERC-7730 format like described [here](https://developers.ledger.com/docs/clear-signing/integration/metadata-file/EIP712-message).

It uses this optional APDU in the flow : [EIP712_FILTERING](ethapp.adoc#eip712-filtering).

## Streaming

The data is streamed to the device, and as there is a lot to store in RAM : all the struct definitions throughout the
entire flow, it was decided to use streaming, so the device starts the message review before having received everything.

This is very efficient with RAM, but this also means the code is more complex to handle this, testing also is because
it makes the navigation difficult with Ragger, and the error-handling is happening as the user is already reviewing the
message which is far from ideal.
